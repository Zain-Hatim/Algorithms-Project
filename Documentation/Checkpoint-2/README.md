# Implementation of the Optimal Karger-Stein Algorithm for k-Cut (Based on Gupta, Lee, and Li)

This README.md details the low-level implementation of the Karger-Stein algorithm for the k-cut problem, following the approach presented in "The Karger-Stein Algorithm Is Optimal for k-Cut" by Gupta, Lee, and Li. This implementation aims to achieve the near-optimal $\hat{O}(n^k)$ time complexity by employing a recursive contraction strategy.

## 1. Algorithm Overview

The algorithm is a randomized recursive procedure based on repeatedly contracting edges of the graph. The probability of contracting an edge is proportional to its weight. The recursion continues with adjusted parameters until a small number of vertices remain. By carefully analyzing the probability of a minimum k-cut surviving these contractions and employing a specific recursive structure, the algorithm finds a minimum k-cut with high probability.

## 2. Data Structures

The following data structures are chosen for an efficient implementation:

*   Weighted Graph: The graph $G = (V, E, w)$ will be represented using an **adjacency list**. For each vertex $u \in V$, we will maintain a list of its neighbors $v$ and the weight $w(u, v)$ of the edge connecting them. This representation is suitable for iterating over edges incident to a vertex and for implementing edge contraction. To handle **multi-edges** that arise during contraction, the adjacency list will store pairs of (neighbor, weight). If contracting an edge creates a new edge between two vertices that already have an edge, their weights will be summed.

*   Vertex Representation: Vertices will be represented by unique integer identifiers (from 0 to $n-1$ initially). When vertices are contracted, a **disjoint-set data structure (Union-Find)** will be used to keep track of which original vertices belong to the current super-vertex. Each set in the Union-Find structure will represent a contracted vertex, and the representative of the set will serve as the identifier for the super-vertex.

*   Edge List (Auxiliary): An auxiliary list of all edges in the current graph, along with their weights and original endpoints, will be maintained to facilitate the **weighted random edge sampling**. This list will need to be updated after each contraction.

## 3. Implementation Steps

The implementation will follow a recursive structure:

### 3.1. Initialization

1.  Read the input graph with $n$ vertices and weighted edges.
2.  Initialize the adjacency list representation of the graph.
3.  Create an initial edge list containing all edges and their weights.
4.  Initialize the Union-Find data structure, where each original vertex is in its own set.

### 3.2. Recursive Function `RecursiveKCut(graph, vertex_count, iteration_number)`

This function will perform the core recursive steps:

1.  Base Case: If `vertex_count` is less than or equal to a small constant (related to $k$, as discussed in the paper's analysis for small vertex counts), run a basic k-cut finding procedure (or continue with more contractions until $k$ super-vertices remain) and return the resulting cut.

2.  Determine Contraction Probability: Based on the current `vertex_count` (let's denote it as $n_{current}$) and the `iteration_number`, calculate the probability $p = 1 - e^{-t/\lambda_k}$ for contracting each edge, where $t$ is a parameter set as $t = \frac{1}{2} \ln(n_{current})$ (following the paper's strategy). Since $\lambda_k$ (the minimum k-cut value) is generally unknown, we will need to either:
    *   **Assume a known or estimated $\lambda_k$:** For initial implementation, one could start by assuming $\lambda_k = 1$ or using a known approximation if available. A more robust implementation would involve techniques discussed in the paper, such as guessing $\lambda_k$ within a range.
    *   **Adapt the probability directly based on the total edge weight:** Alternatively, one could sample edges with probability proportional to their weight, as in the original Karger-Stein algorithm, and the recursive analysis of Gupta, Lee, and Li provides the theoretical justification for its optimality when applied with the specific recursive structure.

3.  Perform Multiple Trials: The recursive step involves performing multiple independent trials of edge contraction. The number of trials in iteration $i$ is suggested to be around $(n̂_{i-1})^{k/2} \cdot (1 - (n̂_{i-1})^{-3k/2})$, where $n̂_i$ is a target number of vertices in iteration $i$ (approximately $(n̂_{i-1})^{1/2}$).

4.  Edge Contraction in Each Trial: For each trial:
    a. Create a copy of the current graph and the Union-Find structure.
    b. Iterate through the edges in the edge list.
    c. For each edge $(u, v)$ with weight $w(u, v)$, decide whether to contract it based on the calculated probability $p$ (or by weighted sampling).
    d. **Contract Operation:** If an edge $(u, v)$ is to be contracted:
        i. Find the representatives of the sets containing $u$ and $v$ in the Union-Find structure (say, $rep\_u$ and $rep\_v$).
        ii. If $rep\_u$ and $rep\_v$ are different, merge their sets in the Union-Find structure. Let the new representative be $rep_{new}$.
        iii. Update the adjacency list of $rep_{new}$. Iterate through the neighbors of $rep\_u$ and $rep\_v$. For each neighbor $w$:
            *   If $w$ is not $rep\_u$ or $rep\_v$, the edge $(rep_{new}, w)$ is formed. If an edge between $rep_{new}$ and $w$ already exists, add the weight of the new edge to the existing weight.
            *   Remove any self-loops (edges where both endpoints are the same after merging).
        iv. Update the edge list by removing the contracted edge and potentially adding/updating edges between the newly formed super-vertex and others.

5.  Recursive Call: After performing the contractions in a trial, let $H$ be the contracted graph with $n'$ vertices. If $n'$ is less than or equal to a target number $n̂_i$, recursively call `RecursiveKCut(H, n', iteration_number + 1)`.

6.  Keep Track of Best Cut: Maintain a variable to store the minimum weight k-cut found across all recursive calls. When the base case is reached (or when the number of remaining super-vertices equals $k$), determine the k-cut by examining the edges in the original graph that now have their endpoints in different connected components (represented by the $k$ super-vertices). Update the minimum weight k-cut if a better one is found.

7.  Return Result: After all trials and recursive calls complete, return the minimum weight k-cut found.

### 3.3. Top-Level Function

1.  Initialize the process by calling `RecursiveKCut(initial_graph, initial_vertex_count, 0)`.
2.  The function will return the minimum weight set of edges that form a k-cut.

## 4. Key Implementation Details and Considerations

*   Handling Edge Weights: The probability of selecting an edge for contraction must be proportional to its weight. This can be implemented by calculating the total weight of all edges and then selecting an edge based on a random value within this total weight range.

*   Managing Multi-Edges: After contracting vertices $u$ and $v$, if there were multiple edges between a neighbor $w$ and either $u$ or $v$, these will become parallel edges between the new super-vertex and $w$. The weights of these parallel edges must be summed. The adjacency list representation should be designed to handle this, for example, by updating the weight associated with the existing edge if a parallel one is formed.

*   Tracking Contracted Vertices: The Union-Find data structure is crucial for efficiently determining which original vertices belong to each super-vertex at the end of the algorithm. This allows for the reconstruction of the k-cut in terms of the original edges.

*   Recursive Parameters and Stopping Conditions: The paper's analysis provides guidance on the number of recursive steps and the target number of vertices in each step to achieve the optimal runtime. The parameters $t_i$ and the number of trials in each iteration are critical for the algorithm's performance.

*   Estimating $\lambda_k$: As mentioned earlier, the exact value of the minimum k-cut $\lambda_k$ is usually unknown. The paper discusses strategies such as first computing an approximation or making polylogarithmic guesses for $\lambda_k$. Implementing such a strategy would be a refinement for a more practical algorithm.

*   (Conceptual) Graph Sparsification: The paper mentions using the Nagamochi-Ibaraki algorithm to sparsify the graph as a preprocessing step. While not strictly necessary for a basic implementation of the recursive contraction, this technique can reduce the number of edges and potentially improve the efficiency of edge sampling in dense graphs. Implementing this would involve using the Nagamochi-Ibaraki algorithm to obtain a sparse subgraph with at most $\lambda_k n$ edges that preserves all minimum k-cuts.

*   (Conceptual) Role of the Extremal Bound and Sunflower Lemma: The theoretical optimality of the algorithm relies on the analysis involving an extremal bound on the number of small cuts, which in turn uses the Sunflower Lemma. While the implementation itself doesn't directly involve the Sunflower Lemma or the proof of the extremal bound, understanding these concepts is essential for appreciating why the specific recursive structure and contraction probabilities lead to an optimal algorithm.

## 5. Returning the k-Cut

When the recursive process (or the base case) results in a graph with $k$ (or fewer) super-vertices, the k-cut needs to be determined. This is done by:

1.  Identifying the $k$ remaining super-vertices (if more than $k$ remain in the base case, a simple approach would be to consider all partitions into $k$ non-empty sets of the original vertices represented by the super-vertices).
2.  For every pair of these $k$ super-vertices, examine the original edges of the input graph.
3.  If an original edge had its two endpoints belonging to different super-vertices in the final contracted graph, it is part of the k-cut.
4.  The k-cut is the set of all such original edges, and its weight is the sum of their weights. The algorithm aims to find the k-cut with the minimum total weight.

This detailed breakdown provides a solid foundation for implementing the optimal Karger-Stein algorithm for the k-cut problem as described in the referenced paper. Remember that achieving the theoretical optimal runtime requires careful adherence to the recursive structure and parameters outlined in the paper's analysis.
